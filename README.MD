Thanks for visiting the source code repositiory for my website.

The site was built from my University campus in Tokyo as a part of a self-driven Hackathon-type project.
As with most of my hack projects, I  choose something that would be of use to my near-future - as I will soon be job-searching, I decided to make a website to introduce myself.

As of the first writing of this file, I have finished setting my DNS for both www and non-www, and for the ME and COM TLDs.
Future work will involve 'un-templating' the about page, and setting up more robust sub-pages, (including some debugging to find why a couple of the Japanese pages fail to stay in Japanese).

Open-source contributions, as with most things, are welcomed! Please make your own branch and submit requests when you have finished work to add to the site.
As the Hugo site builder and the 'coder' theme used are also public-source, please feel free to clone this git repository for your own use as well!
(I think the PDF resume folder is actually quite a good idea, for example.)

Thanks and happy coding!
